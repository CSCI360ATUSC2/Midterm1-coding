# CSCI 360 (2024 Fall) Midterm 1 Coding Problems

Submit Problem 7 **ONLY** in this GitHub repo; submit other questions in the format of PDF onto Gradescope. 

If you submit certain questions to the other portal, those questions will not be graded and will result in zero grade.

## Problem 7
- Use the same Anaconda environment as Lab 2. Use the command to activate the environment:
```
conda activate cs360_lab2
```
- Put all your implementation in `P7/p7.py` including helper functions, helper classes, etc. Do not modify declaration of function `a_star_search` and script `test.py`.
- There is no hidden test cases for Problem 7. 
- Comment your code well -- this worths up to 10% of this problem.
- You cannot use late day quota (those are for homeworks only). Each late day up to 3 days after regular submission deadline will be penalized for 10% of total grade. If the submission is 4+ days late, the exam will receive 0 points.
