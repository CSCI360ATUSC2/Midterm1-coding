# CSCI 360 (2024 Fall) Midterm 1 Coding Problems

Submit Problem 7 **ONLY** in this GitHub repo; submit other questions in the format of PDF onto Gradescope. 

If you submit certain questions to the other portal, those questions will not be graded and will result in zero grade.

## Problem 7
- Use the same Anaconda environment as Lab 2. Use the command to activate the environment:
```
conda activate cs360_lab2
```
- Put all your implementation in `P7/p7.py` including helper functions, helper classes, etc. Do not modify declaration of function `a_star_search` and script `test.py`.
- There is no hidden test cases for Problem 7. 
- Comment your code well -- this worths up to 10% of this problem.
